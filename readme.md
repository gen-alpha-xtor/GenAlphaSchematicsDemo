[GenAlpha Schematics](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gen-alpha-xtor.schematics-vscode) enables editing real, production-quality schematics, live in [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com).

GenAlpha operates on the same [OpenAccess](https://si2.org/openaccess)  databases and schematics supported by leading silicon foundry PDKs.


## This Demo 

GenAlpha is designed to run on-premises, on your corporate or institutional servers. [Instructions below](#getting-genalpha). This demo repository can be cloned and run locally, or can be run in GitHub's cloud-native [codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). 


## Demo Schematics

The schematics in this demo repository come courtesy of the open-source [ASAP7 predictive PDK](https://asap.asu.edu/), maintained and distributed by [The OpenROAD Project](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project). 


## Getting GenAlpha

GenAlpha Schematics runs as an extension to the popular open-source [VsCode IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com). It is designed to run on your data, on your own company or institutional servers, running any supported platform (RedHat/ CentOS Linux 7 or 8). It runs like other IDE extensions, such as those for language highlighting or debugging - as *you*. Your user account, your directories, with only access to what you yourself can see. GenAlpha does not require any priviledged access (e.g. `root`, `sudo`) to install or set up. 

GenAlpha is most easily installed from the [VsCode extension marketplace](vscode:extension/gen-alpha-xtor.schematics-vscode). It pairs particularly well with VsCode's built-in [remote development via SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) extension, which enables editing remote (server) data on your preferred local OS and UI, without ever transfering any files between the two.
